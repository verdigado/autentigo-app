During the setup process, a cryptographic keypair is generated and stored by this app.
This keypair enhances security by ensuring the authenticity of the users during the authentication process.

The public key is then sent to custom keycloak authenticator SPI. This SPI must support the required API
to store the public key. On subsequent authentication requests during the login flow, the user can use
this app to send a request to keycloak either to approve or deny the authentication.

The keycloak SPI validates requests by checking the apps private key signature supplied in the request.
If the signature is valid and the authentication request was accepted by the user, then the login
flow step is completed.
