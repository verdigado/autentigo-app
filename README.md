## Deployment Setup

Fastlane can be installed in multiple ways. The preferred method is with Bundler.

First install ruby on your system. If you use macOS, system Ruby is not recommended. For macOS and Linux, rbenv is one of the most popular ways to manage your Ruby environment.
If you choose rbenv to install ruby, bundler will be available too.

Every time you run fastlane, use `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`
To update fastlane, just run `bundle update fastlane`
